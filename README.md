# Code along 100 days of web development

This is my version of the 100 days of web development challenge made by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller & Manuel Lorenz.

Day_9 Is a completely new website, so i deleted all the content of the old one. I could have made new repository, but meh

Day_10 Decided to make folders for each 'project' (new website) cuz apparantly thats a thing

Day_15 days 12,13,14 were about GIT, which i was familiar with thus not interested.
